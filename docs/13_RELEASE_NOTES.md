## 0.4.0 Beta

While this is the initial release of the *fire-behavior-simulator* package, it is the next evolution of the experimental *behaveplus-core* and *behaveplus-radical* packages.  It has therefore undergone considerable regression and unit testing, validation testing against BehavePlus outputs, and has been used to develop several NodeJs and web browser applications.

This release includes all the BehavePlus modeling capabilities with the following exceptions:
 - the fire containment module is currently under development and will be added in a future release, and
 - the 'expected value' method of estimating spread rate through 2 fuels is not implemented.
