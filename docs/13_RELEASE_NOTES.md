## 0.5.0 April 8, 2021

This release updates all the documentation.


## 0.4.0 Beta

While this is the initial release of the *fire-behavior-simulator* package, it is the next evolution of the experimental *behaveplus-core* and *behaveplus-radical* packages.  It has therefore undergone considerable regression and unit testing, validation testing against *BehavePlus* outputs, and has been used to develop several Node.js and web browser applications.

This release includes all the BehavePlus modeling capabilities with the following exceptions:
 - the fire containment module is currently under development as a separate package and will not not included in the *fire-behavior-simulator*, and
 - the 'expected value' method of estimating spread rate through 2 fuels is not implemented.
