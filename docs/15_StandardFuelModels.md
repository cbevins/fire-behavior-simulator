The **standard** fuel models may be selected via their **key** strings.

The 13 original standard fuel models specified by Rothermel (1972) and illustrated in Anderson's (1982) photo guide are listed below.  All 13 original fuel models are *static*; there is no transfer of cured herbaceous fuel loads from the live into the dead fuel category.

  | Key | Name |
  |-----|------|
  | '1' | Short grass |
  | '2' | Timber grass and understory |
  | '3' | Tall grass |
  | '4' | Chaparral |
  | '5' | Brush |
  | '6' | Dormant brush, hardwood slash |
  | '7' | Southern rough |
  | '8' | Short needle litter |
  | '9' | Long needle or hardwood litter |
  | '10' | Timber litter & understory |
  | '11' | Light logging slash |
  | '12' | Medium logging slash |
  | '13' | Heavy logging slash |

The 40 additional standard fuel models specified by Scott and Burgan (2005) are listed below.  All 40 fuel models are *dynamic*; any cured cured herbaceous fuel loading they may have is transferred from the live into the dead fuel category.
